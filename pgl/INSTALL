This README is about installation of pgl. For a description and more information
please have a look at pgl/docs/README.




Table of Contents:
==================

1.) Manual installation
2.) Installed files (uninstall)
3.) Build dependencies and runtime environment
4.) Available packages, build scripts and other distribution specific tips




1.) Manual installation
=======================

This is the general method to install pgl. Please also have a look at the
distribution specific section (chapter 4).

Step 1: Get the source:
-----------------------
Either get the latest stable release from peerguardian.sourceforge.net and
unpack it.
Or get the current development code:
git clone git://peerguardian.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/peerguardian/peerguardian


Step 2: Base configuration (Makefile)
-------------------------------------
pgl consists of three components: the daemon pgld, the command line interface
pglcmd and the GUI pgl-gui. In the pgl/Makefile you can enable/disable these
components and configure the paths pgl is installed to and uses.

For a slick installation you can turn off dbus support (needed for pgl-gui).
Especially for embedded devices (like router or NAS box) you might set the
LOWMEM option to "yes" to disable storing of textual range descriptions.


Step 3: Install pgl's dependencies
----------------------------------
Install the build dependencies (including the development headers) and runtime
environment for the components (see chapter 3).


Step 4: Compilation and installation
------------------------------------
If you are using the development version from the git repository generate
the autotools files first. Go to the peerguardian/pgl directory and run:
  ./autogen.sh

To update the files run:
  autoreconf

Pgl uses autotools which comes with several configure-switches you have
to check before compiling. Go to the directory where you have extracted pgl and
run:
  ./configure --help

Check the options and the paths. There are some common paths and options you should
consider to set like:
  --prefix         [default: /usr/local]
  --sysconfdir     [default: $prefix/etc]
  --localstatedir  [default: $prefix/var]
  --with-initddir  [default: $sysconfdir/init.d]
  --with-logdir    [default: $localstatedir/log/pgl]
  --with-piddir    [default: $localstatedir/run]
  --with-tmpdir    [default: /tmp]

Now you should be clear about the settings you need for your distribution and 
run something similar to:
  ./configure --prefix=/my/prefix --with-initddir=/my/initddir
  make
  make install




2.) Uninstall
===============================

To uninstall issue the following command:
  make uninstall




3.) Build dependencies and runtime environment
==============================================

Build dependencies:
- autotools (autoconf, automake, libtoolize)
- nfnetlink development files
- libnetfilter-queue development files
- libdbus development files (optional)
- zlib development files (optional, for loading gz compressed blocklists
  directly)

 Build dependencies pgl-gui:
- Qt4 development files (including Qt4 dbus)

 Runtime environment pgld:
- the above libraries
- iptables (required)
- netfilter kernel support (kernel >= 2.6.13 for NFQUEUE support)
  Either as modules or directly built in the kernel. These are the modules that
  are loaded here. Note that "xt_" may be named "ip_" or "ipt_" on older
  systems. This list was compiled with:
    lsmod|grep -E "^x|^nf|^ip"|grep -Ev "^ip6|^ipv6"|sed "s| .*||"|sort
  iptable_filter
  ip_tables
  ipt_REJECT
  nf_conntrack
  nf_conntrack_ipv4
  nf_defrag_ipv4
  nfnetlink
  nfnetlink_queue
  x_tables
  xt_iprange
  xt_mark
  xt_multiport
  xt_NFQUEUE
  xt_state
  xt_tcpudp
- dbus daemon (optional)

 Runtime environment pglcmd:
- pgld
- wget (optional, needed for blocklists update)
- p7zip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .7z)
- unzip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .zip)
- start-stop-daemon (optional)
- awk, sed, grep, basename, dirname, cat, cd, mv, cp, zcat, md5sum, renice,
  pidof (those should really be on every system)
- /usr/bin/printf (optional, needed during "update" for archive type
  detection)
- /lib/lsb/init-functions (optional,there's a copy built in)
- NetworkManager (optional, needed for automatic whitelisting of newly
  brought up network interfaces. Not needed in Debian.)

 Runtime environment pgl-gui:
- pgld
- pglcmd
- Qt4




4.) Available packages, build scripts and other distribution specific tips
==========================================================================

pgl was written and tested under Debian Gnu/Linux Squeeze. However it should run
under every Linux system. It is our goal to make life as easy as possible for
users and packagers.

NOTE FOR PACKAGERS:
If you are a packager just contact us at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerguardian/ or
jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net.
We'll gladly give you all possible support, change the code if feasible and
publish your work. Of course you are welcome to join the project and e.g.
commit directly to the git repository.
To test if pgl is correctly integrated in your system, you'll have to verify
the correct handling of the init, cron, if-up and logrotate files (all pglcmd,
logrotate also for pgld), and may test if LSB="/lib/lsb/init-functions" works.

If you know something missing in this list, please tell us!
