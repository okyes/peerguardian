ChangeLog PeerGuardian Linux (pgl)


pgl 2.0.2~WIP

  [ jre ]
  * email stats on every stop/restart (except when the system is halted). Reset
    stats in email_stats instead of just dumping them.
  * default to use builtin LSB init-functions instead of systemwide functions
  * added option to activate the iptables setup only for specified interfaces.
  * added pgl-gui to common GNU Makefile buildsystem, removed cmake relicts
  * Makefile: removed "-" from variable names, because this sometimes causes
    problems.
  * Renamed ..._FORWARD variables to ..._FWD. If only the old name is used, its
    values are used.
  * pglcmd.lib, kernel module loading: check if kernel support is available or
    try to load kernel modules in any case. If this fails, but the kernel
    support is needed for a given configuration, exit.

-- jre <jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net>  WIP


pgl 2.0.1

  [ jre ]
  * use "-m multiport --ports" for port whitelisting
  * added delete_iptables if inserting iptables fails
  * added direct support for all currently available iblocklist URLs in the
    format http://list.iblocklist.com/lists/<author>/<list>. They are recognized
    to be the same as the cryptic iblocklist URLs, and if available the original
    upstream URLs. Simplified code.
  * updated documentation and 2.0.0 ChangeLog

pgl 2.0.0

  * initial release, based on moblock/nfblock and blockcontrol

  [ jre ]
  * common Gnu make buildsystem for pgld and pglcmd
  * updated documentation

  [ Cade Robinson ]
  * common cmake buildsystem for pgld, pglcmd and pgl-gui (superseded by
    Gnu make buildsystem, but still needed for pgl-gui)

  [ Dimitris Palyvos-Giannas ]
  * work on pgl-gui has started, but is not in a working state, yet


  * CHANGES NFBLOCK - PGLD

    [ jre ]
    - transition to pglcmd at peerguardian.sourceforge.net
      - removed cron* and init.d. This is covered by pglcmd.
      - removed dl-blocklistpro.pl: blocklistpro is for manual download only. Of
        course we honour the decisions of the blocklist providers. The
        underlying single lists of ipfilter.dat can be downloaded with pglcmd.
    - updated output when pgld is called without option
    - change logrotate to work without pglcmd being installed

    [ Cade Robinson ]
    - Changed logging
      - added logging to log file
      - do logging to logfile, syslog and dbus with one function. dbus logging
        is broken now!
      - removed "--no-syslog" and rather use "-s" to enable syslogging
      - Changed hit lines to use "||" since descriptions in block file had "|"
        in them.
      - Tag the lines logged with INFO: ERROR: STATS: or WARN:.
      - Log the number of IPs that fall in the loaded ranges.
      - Log IP, port and proto
      - Don't log merging ranges
    - Added -m option to load, merge, dump lists.
      - Dump in p2p format, if in LOWMEM just dump the range
    - Cleaner blocklist handling
      - Major change to in memory blocklist.
        - remove subentries
        - fix merging and shrinking of array
        - don't pass blocklist pointer around - don't really need to
        - take out subranges, don't trim, simpler design
      - Change parser.c to only need an ASCII parser and a binary parser
        function
      - allow just a range line in blocklists for LOWMEM mode
      - Allow blocklist lines to be 350 chars (up from 255)
      - Allow the range name / label on the line to be 300 chars (up from 199)
      - Concat the range names together on merged ranges
      - Truncate all labels to be 64 chars in memory only
      - Change blocklist_trim to blocklist_merge for clarity
      - handle variable argument list separately for every log destination
      - Make sure lable truncate is in the name array
      - Allow blocklist to be read from STDIN
      - Remove -f (blocklist to load)
      - fix parsing ipfilter.dat line to follow the standard found at:
        http://wiki.phoenixlabs.org/wiki/DAT_Format
      - Fix parsing ipfilter.dat lines (Change the %199c to %199s)
    - Reordered functions in pgld:
      - Change the startup functions order to guarantee it started correctly
        before returning from pgld command.
      - moved closelog (for syslogging) to just before the program exit so we
        can log up to the end of running
    - removed "--no-dbus" and rather use -d to enable dbus
    - Added nfq_unbind_pf before the nfq_bind_pf in start up to make sure the
      queue is closed.
    - Make local functions static and move order to make static work.
    - Comment out libdl from Makefile when built with dbus (do we need it?
      building .deb complains about being useless)
    - Fix up code formats, remove extra blanks, remove useless commented code
    - always run pgld as daemon, removed -D option
    - Change to use unsigned int for positive values (hits, count, etc)
    - Change GETIPINFO from an included cpp "function" to an actual function.
    - Change queue_num to 16bit int to conform with libnetfilter_queue
    - Fix printing of IPs in big-endian (int2ip function)
    - Change name of assemble_ip to ip2int to match int2ip
    - Change a lot of int's to unsigned 32-bit int's
    - Fix issues if a range ends at 255.255.255.255.
    - Fix issues if a range is 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255
    - Added listing the name of the file loading in the num entries loaded line.
    - Make some error messages more clear.
    - Don't assume to use stdin if filename fails to open.
    - Check if there is filename first, if not open stdin instead.
    - Add quotes around file name to make the name easier to read if there is
      spaces in the file name


  * CHANGES BLOCKCONTROL - PGLCMD

    [ jre ]
    - transition to pglcmd at peerguardian.sourceforge.net
      - removed automatic daemon name detection
      - removed tests for obsolete blockcontrol variables
      - removed CUSTOM_DAEMON_OPTS, all pgld options are (and have to) be
        supported by pglcmd directly
    - blocklist handling:
      - premerge single blocklists (pgld -m)
      - allow several master blocklists: all blocklists in MASTER_BLOCKLIST_DIR,
        except those which end in "~", are used. This allows to combine
        pglcmd's automatic blocklist management with manual placed
        blocklists ("local lists") without any configuration hassle.
      - removed "notimestamp" and "locallist" option from blocklists.list
      - force to build master blocklist with "force-update". Otherwise only
        build, if the relevant configuration changed.
      - removed all code for blocklist format specification
      - allow spaces in master blocklist names.
      - remove "used" directory for single blocklists
      - move test_BLOCKLISTS_DIR to get_blocklist
    - fixed watchdog logging
    - Email if watchdog detects a problem, added option WD_MAILTO.
    - Added simplification that is necessary on Synology, but reverted pidof
      command simplification because otherwise the watchdog status is shown as
      not running
    - remove iptables rules again, if starting the daemon fails
    - on "test" wait a second to give the daemon time to log the current block
    - init: added Should-Start/Stop dbus
    - removed shebang from pglcmd.main

    [ Cade Robinson ]
    - Added "email_stat" function to email stats.
    - Change pgld logrotate to email stats, rotate, then reopen
    - hide .files in MASTER_BLOCKLISTS
    - build_blocklist: added cleanup in the "cat --squeeze-blank"
    - added configuration option enable/disable compression of blocklist
      (COMPRESS). Not implemented yet.
