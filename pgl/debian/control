Description: PeerGuardian Linux - pgld
 PeerGuardian Linux (pgl) is a privacy oriented firewall application. It blocks
 connections to and from hosts specified in huge blocklists (thousands or
 millions of IP ranges). pgl is based on the Linux kernel netfilter framework
 and iptables.
 .
 This is the pgl daemon pgld. It uses the netfilter xt_NFQUEUE kernel module
 (available since kernel 2.6.13).

Description: PeerGuardian Linux - pglcmd
 PeerGuardian Linux (pgl) is a privacy oriented firewall application. It blocks
 connections to and from hosts specified in huge blocklists (thousands or
 millions of IP ranges). pgl is based on the Linux kernel netfilter framework
 and iptables.
 .
 This is the pgl command line interface pglcmd. It provides easy ways to
 interact with the pgl daemon and does all common related tasks.
 .
 Features:
  - Start and stop pgld. Or let init do this automatically.
  - Update your blocklists from online sources. Or let cron do this
    automatically. Backups will be used if a problem occurs. Additionally you
    may use your local blocklists.
  - Remove lines by keyword from the blocklists.
  - Handle your iptables rules: use a default setup, easily allow all traffic on
    specific ports and use an allow list, or add your own sophisticated iptables
    rules.
  - Automatically make sure the LAN and the DNS server aren't blocked. If you
    are on a public LAN, you probably want to disable this feature.
  - Check the status and test pgl.
  - Detects if kernel modules are needed and loads them if necessary.
  - Set verbosity and logging options.
  - Provides LSB 3.1 compatible init script.
  - Daily rotation of the logfiles.
