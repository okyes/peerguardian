# blocklists.list - lists the blocklists that pglcmd handles automatically

# Place one URL per line for every blocklist.
# Any line which starts with a # (hash) is a comment and is ignored.

# Have a look at /usr/share/doc/pglcmd/README.blocklists.gz for detailed
# information about some available blocklists.

# Instead or additionally to the blocklists that are specified in this file,
# you can manually put lists in MASTER_BLOCKLIST_DIR (/var/lib/pgl).
# All blocklists in that directory (except those which end in "~" or have a "."
# prefix) are used by pgld. They may be in any supported format and have to be
# either unpacked or gzip'ped. Note that these manually installed blocklists are
# neither updated automatically, nore does IP_REMOVE work for them.

# Do a "pglcmd reload" (or "restart" or "update") when you have edited
# this file.
