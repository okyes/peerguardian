TODO

pglcmd:

- on "stop" remove kernel modules that were inserted by blockcontrol. (see dino's
  synology packaging
  http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/showpost.php?p=128371&postcount=20). Probably
  disable this per default, to avoid problems.

- send error messages to console and logfile. [João]
  Completely rework the logging part, and check if all messages go where they
  should.
  E.g. the watchdog's message currently doesn't land in the logfile.

- add option to temp allow (blockcontrol allow IP and blockcontrol allow-MM IP),
  which inserts the appropriate iptables rules directly.

- add configuration possibility to shut off checking in specific chains
  (FORWARD).

- improve makefile: add (something like) "configure" to configure paths (set the
  paths in the Makefile and adjust all files automatically with sed.)

- fix debconf to use debian/config again.

- expand test to use traceroute (with a timeout)

- build_blocklist: disable concatenating blocklists in .p2b (binary) format.

- adapt test function for peerguardian .p2b v2 binary format blocklist formats.

- [DISCUSS]: if any blocklist is unavailable, should blockcontrol exit (as it does
  currently, in order to give no false security), or continue but return an
  error (if one list is missing, it´s still better to use at least the other
  blocklists).

- [DISCUSS] Block IPv6 completely because currently only IPv4 is checked?


Requests for upstream:

- [nfblock]: use a real allowlist (instead of the iptables whitelisting)

- [iblocklist.com]: This site renames some filenames. So it is not possible to
  use the upstream URL and the iblocklist.com URL, and avoid the second download
  with wget's timestamp option.
