Description: PeerGuardian Linux - pglcmd
 pgl blocks connections from and to hosts, that are listed in a very large
 blocklist. The blocklist can be in one of the following formats: eMule
 "ipfilter.dat", "peerguardian .p2p text" or "peerguardian .p2b v2 binary".
 .
 This is the pgl command line interface pglcmd. It provides easy ways to
 interact with the pgl daemon and does all common related tasks.
 .
 Features:
  - Start and stop pgld. Or let init do this automatically.
  - Update your blocklists from online sources. Or let cron do this
    automatically. Backups will be used if a problem occurs. Additionally you
    may use your local blocklists.
  - Remove lines by keyword from the blocklists.
  - Handle your iptables rules: use a default setup, easily allow all traffic on
    specific ports and use an allow list, or add your own sophisticated iptables
    rules.
  - Automatically make sure the LAN and the DNS server aren't blocked. If you
    are on a public LAN, you probably want to disable this feature.
  - Check the status and test pgl.
  - Detects if kernel modules are needed and loads them if necessary.
  - Set verbosity and logging options.
  - Provides LSB 3.1 compatible init script.
  - Daily rotation of the logfiles.
