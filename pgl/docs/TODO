TODO

pgld:

  - fix logging to dbus

  - use a real allowlist (instead of the iptables whitelisting)

  - add search option that gives all single blocklists (not master blocklist)
    with the range and description that contain a specified IP.

  - make length of range description configurable (with LOWMEM:=range=0)


pglcmd:

  - blockers release pgl-gui:
    - add blockcontrol-pgl configuration transition script
        (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9981209)
        - add it to packaging
    - transition VERBOSITY-->VERBOSE?
        ... or other changes (STDERR, ...)
        See Debian /etc/init.d/skeleton and /etc/default/rcS
        or perhaps: INIT_VERBOSE=$VERBOSITY

  - send error messages to console (STDERR 1>&2) and logfile. [Jo?o]
    Completely rework the logging part, and check if all messages go where they
    should.
    Add dbus support.

  - add pidfile for pglcmd (e.g. to prevent 2 starts at nearly the same time.
    How to handle "update"? - this does not conflict with start.

  - add possibility to shut off cron mails, even if CRON_MAILTO is empty.

  - speed up email_stats
    firing up sendmail takes way too long for e.g. "stop". So make this quicker,
    or do it in the background (what happens then on shutdown?)

  - Send traffic to several NFQUEUE nums with --queue-balance and run multiple
    pgld instances for these nums. This might help on heavy load.

    Alternatively increasing the default receive/send window seems to fix the
    problem:
        sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=8388608
        sysctl -w net.core.wmem_default=8388608

  - on "stop" remove kernel modules that were inserted by blockcontrol. (see
    dino's synology packaging
    http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/showpost.php?p=128371&postcount=20). Probably
    disable this per default, to avoid problems.

  - fix debconf to use debian/config again.
    This stuff is currently in postinst, because otherwise debconf doesn't work
    as expected: Debconf runs twice during installation: first it asks questions
    and then it overwrites the answers with the not-yet modified configuration
    files.
    Further the debconf database is not cleared properly on purge.

  - adapt test function for peerguardian .p2b v2 binary format blocklist
    formats.

  - [DISCUSS]: if any blocklist is unavailable, should pglcmd exit (as it
    does currently, in order to give no false security), or continue but return
    an error (if one list is missing, it's still better to use at least the
    other blocklists).

  - [DISCUSS] Block IPv6 completely because currently only IPv4 is checked?


pgl-gui:

  - add option to temp allow, which inserts the appropriate iptables rules
    directly. (iptables --ctexpire )

  - add whitelisting per IP (normal pglcmd variables), and per IP/port/proto
    (pgl-gui-custom-iptables-insert.sh)


all components:

  - use dbus for communication between components. Especially for logging
    events, instead of parsing the logfiles.

  - use inotify (available since Linux kernel 2.6.13) to reload after
    configuration change.
