blockcontrol (1.3-1~pre2) sid lenny; urgency=low

  * New name: moblock-control is now blockcontrol. Generally names either relate
    to this software, then blockcontrol is used; or to the IPBlocker
    (blockdaemon), such as MoBlock or NFBlock. Then $NAME (moblock or nfblock)
    is used. Changed:
    - directory names: moblock > blockcontrol
    - filenames
    - variable names:
      - MOBLOCK_INIT > INIT
      - MOBLOCK_CRON > CRON
      - SCRIPT_LIB > CONTROL_LIB
      - SCRIPT_DEFAULTS > CONTROL_DEFAULTS
      - CRON_EMAILTO > CRON_MAILTO




  TODO:
  - NEWS
  - transition script for custom iptables rules
  - debian/postinst transition, extra package?
  - formatting
  - documentation
  - add previously moblock-control hints in copyright, etc.
  - check if the recent changes by cader are still present. E.g. the Email
    part in init seems to got lost.
  - Check how NFBlock works with marking on/off.
  - Check howto implement all options of NFBlock.
  - Note in blockcontrol.conf for all variables that only work for one daemon.
  - test and fix update from moblock-control

  SVN-DONE:


  * TODO: add support for moblock -z NFQUEUE length from patch 41_Patch_2589_All
    ow__nfq_set_queue_maxlen__to_be_increased_from_default.dpatch

  * Upstream NFBlock is now NFBlock, changed dependencies and all files.
  * Removed last traces of quickstart (MOBLOCK_INIT="2=") which was only present
    in an development version.
  * Added exit if iptables is not found.
  * Check for ipv6 module before running ip6tables (cader)
  * Email the results of the update rather than let cron email the output (cader)
    This makes for a nicer email message.

moblock-control (1.2-1) sid lenny; urgency=low

  * moblock-control, moblock.if-up, cron.daily, init, debian/postinst:
    - moved most code as functions to moblock-control.lib and
      moblock-control.defaults.lib and source these files instead.
    - Use the same initialization code in these files. If moblock.conf
      and moblock-control.defaults.lib are not installed at the default places,
      CONTROL_CONF and DEFAULTS_LIB have to be adjusted in all these files, 
    - Improved handling of missing configuration files.
    - improved/fixed regular expressions for sed and grep
  * New handling of blocklists:
    - php redirects are supported now. This allows to use the lists from
      iblocklist.com.
    - Download all blocklists from the newly supported iblocklist.com php URLs.
    - the blocklist archive type is detected by file header instead of file
      suffix.
    - The single blocklists are saved in new places now (but still under
      /var/spool/moblock/.
    - Removed variable BLOCKLISTS_DIR_USED.
    - The master blocklist (e.g. guarding.p2p) is now saved in
      /var/lib/moblock/ instead of /etc/moblock/.
    - Already existing single and master blocklists are moved to the new places
      on updates from versions prior to 1.2. (debian/postinst)
    - If the blocklist configuration changed, the master blocklist is rebuilt on
      "start" (Not just on "reload" and "update").
    - Missing blocklists are downloaded during the master blocklist built
      (previously a "update" was necessary).
    - The (Debian) installation only requires the blocklists (and therefore
      network access) to be available if the automatic start is selected.
    - Really ignore all comments when reading blocklists.list.
    - debconf: Keep "http://" when readding a previously commented blocklists,
      instead of just replacing the comment line with LIST_URL
    - Moved extraction of blocklists from build_blocklist to update_blocklist
    - If blocklists.list, BLOCKLIST_FORMAT or IP_REMOVE changed since the last
      build_blocklist, the master blocklist is rebuilt on "start", too.
      Therefore introduce a new variable MD5SUM_FILE (per default
      /var/spool/moblock/MD5SUM).
    - build_blocklist if the test for the master blocklist fails, and only exit
      if this fails, too.
    - update_blocklists does no more contain a do_reload. This is just a
      internal change, the behaviour of the script did not change because of
      this.
    - only build_blocklist on reload if daemon is running.
    - If build_blocklist fails because of a missing blocklist, do a
      get_blocklist LIST
    - use p7zip instead of 7z, and zcat instead of gunzip
    - keep standard IFS
    - New variable WGET_OPTS to specify the download application and additional
      options. This allows e.g. to specify a proxy for blocklist downloading.
    - The bluetack nipfilter.dat.gz and pipfilter.dat.gz are no more
      downloadable directly( instead a 1 byte file is downloaded). So they get
      disabled by debconf.
    - Bluetack "templist" is now "badpeers". The URL is renamed by debconf
      automatically.
  * start_daemon
    - reorganised code
    - fixed MoBlock (LSB=1) start options to also work without marking
    - use LOG_TIMESTAMP_OPT as first option for moblock, because of reports that
      it doesn't work immediately otherwise.
  * LSB:
    - new setting LSB_MODE=2: don't use "-p $PIDFILE" in start_daemon and
      killproc. Use this for broken init-functions like Fedora Core 9's (and
      other redhat variants). See
      http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/showpost.php?p=120563&postcount=47
    - never use "-p $PIDFILE" in pidofproc
    - init-functions: updated to Debian version 3.2-20, completely renewed.
  * Whitelisting:
    - per default disable allow.p2p for forwarded traffic.
    - iptables-custom-[insert|remove].sh:
      - minor changes
      - real life example for combined IP range and port whitelisting
    - whitelist LAN automatically: detect the actual subnetmask (instead of
      using a hardcoded 24)
  * replaced backticks for command substitution with the $(command) syntax,
    since it is considered obsolete by the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4 and
    POSIX standards.
  * use sed with -i option to edit files directly (no .tmp)
  * added hint how to turn off daemon's logging to the logfile (moblock.conf,
    debian/templates).
  * automatically create the directories CONF_DIR, MASTER_BLOCKLIST_DIR,
    BLOCKLISTS_DIR and LOG_DIR if they are missing.
  * daemon_status: fixed output for "dead daemon, but /var/run/ pid file
    exists".
  * test_external:
    - don't exit in function but return a value
    - simplified IFS setting
  * Also show configured blocklists on show_config
  * NFBlock support:
    - debian/control: moved nfblockd from conflicts to depends (alternatively to
      moblock).
    - Check what daemon is installed in PATH and set NAME, DESC and DAEMON
      accordingly. Per default don't set them manually in moblock.conf.
      (moblock-control, init, cron and if-up)
    - accept QUEUE as IPTABLES_TARGET for NFBlock, since this is the same as
      NFQUEUE 0.
  * installation/debconf:
    - postinst: removed the start||reload||update sequence. The normal start
      added by dh_installdeb for the init file is enough now, because of the new
      blocklist build/download changes.
    - Therefore also removed the debconf question fail_installation again, which
      allowed a non-broken installation although the blocklist was still
      missing. Hint to set MOBLOCK_INIT=0 instead.
    - debian/postinst: removed hint how to abort "tail -f" to avoid
      misunderstandings (it's not about aborting the update process).
  * debian/patches/50_debianize.dpatch: renewed
  * debian/patches/51_hardy.dpatch: completely new, check return code of
    killproc and accept 3 as success.
  * packaging:
    - corrected error to not produce a Debian native package (already in 1.1-1).
    - debian/control: removed dpkg-dev from build-depends since this is already
      build-essential.

moblock-control (1.1-1) sid lenny; urgency=low

  * blocklist changes:
    - per default the new blocklists by TBG (The Blocklist Group) from
      tbg.iblocklist.com/Lists are used now instead of bluetack's.
      (blocklists.list, debian/postinst, debian/templates, README.blocklists).
  * use iblocklist.com as TESTHOST (moblock-control, moblock.conf)
  * debconf:
    - select-blocklists: use more code independently of the selected blocklist
      format, major code changes
    - ipfilter.dat is a multiselect question now instead of select.
  * moblock-control:
    - update_blocklist: removed separate notimestamp function. The
      functionality is implemented as fallback for all remote blocklists since
      many versions. Implemented backwards compatibility code.
    - Check all traffic (not only NEW) for IPTABLES_ACTIVATION="2". Adjusted
      moblock.conf, debian/templates, debian/postinst.
    - Only check for netfilter STATE support and load the kernel module, if 
      IPTABLES_ACTIVATION="1" is set.
    - Added IPv6 to "status" output.
    - improved logging messages

 -- jre <jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net>  Fri, 26 Sep 2008 13:05:49 +0200

moblock-control (1.0-1) sid lenny; urgency=low

  * Changed packaging: moblock-control has been split off the moblock package
    and is a separate project now.

  * execute custom iptables scripts also for IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1" to allow e.g.
    sophisticated whitelisting rules in combination with moblock-control's
    iptables management. Thanks, Felix Triebel, for the hints about iptables
    owner module and IPv6.
  * changed default NFQUEUE number to 92 (instead of 0), to avoid conflicts with
    other firewalls.
  * moblock-control :
    - build_blocklist: set $SINGLE_REMOVE in double quotes to fix bug with
      whitespace in IP_REMOVE (Closes: sf.net bug #2069337)
    - removed warning that the variables WHITE_IP_[IN|OUT|FORWARD] are
      deprecated. I don't intend to remove them any more.
    - do_start (test if netfilter support is built in the kernel directly):
      first check if files exist before grep'ping them.
  * documentation and output/logging updates
  * deprecate "notimestamp" option for blocklists, because this is implemented
    as fallback for all remote blocklists:
    - blocklists.list: removed documentation
    - moblock-control: add hint
  * debian/postinst:
    - accept "reconfigure" as $1, the functionality is the same as "configure"
    - always save non-default debconf answers in /etc/default/moblock
    - minor changes
  * debconf:
    - if a necessary blocklist download fails on installation, ask if
      moblock-control shall be listed as "unconfigured" (current setting) or if
      the installation shall be seen as successful.
    - templates, config: removed "configuration" question to ask if user wants
      to use values from the config files. This is now always the case.
    - removed debconf question for IPTABLES_TARGET_WHITELISTING. The variable
      itself stays of course. The question was not really useful, since RETURN
      should be good for everybody and custom values aren't possible within the
      debconf setting. Further the question was buggy before.
    - removed unimportant debconf questions (variable stays):
      - REJECT_MARK
      - ACCEPT_MARK
    - config: remove variables which tell if a configuration file is present -
      unnecessary.
    - moved config code to postinst, this seems to solve all current issues with
      debconf, see http://bugs.debian.org/352697 and BUGS.
  * debconf, moblock.conf:
    - WHITE_TCP_OUT: change port numbers (80 443) to associated service names
      (http https) because of a bug in mobloquer (0.5).
  * debian/control:
    - added "Bugs:" line, so that mails created by "reportbug" are sent to me.
    - add hint that internet access is needed to complete the installation.
  * debian/patches/51_hardy.dpatch:
    - renewed to get rid of whole code copy in the patch.
  * add Ubuntu hardy specific patch directly via debian/rules, if the version
    read from changelog contains "hardy". Previously this was done by a
    not-packaged external script. Therefore add "dpkg-dev" to build-depends in
    debian/control.
  * added debian/watch
  * fixed typo deprecated - depreciated; again, this time the other way ;-)
  * added Ubuntu intrepid ibex

moblock (0.9~rc2-17) sid lenny; urgency=low

  * [ Ubuntu hardy only ]
    Added fix for hardy LSB init-functions: stopping a stopped daemon gives fail
    instead of success there. See also Debian Bug report #475258, lsb-base:
    killproc returns 3 if daemon not running. (debian/patches/51_hardy.dpatch
    and debian/prerm).

  * kernel module loading:
    - check the values in /proc/net/ to see if kernel modules need to be loaded.
      Therefore removed the obsolete configuration option IPTABLES_MODULES.
      (moblock-control, moblock.conf, debian/templates, debian/config,
      debian/postinst, README.Debian, README.moblock-control,
      moblock-control.1).
      Thanks anonymous for the patch 2039301 at moblock-deb.sf.net.
    - Load modules quietly (modprobe -q) (moblock-control).
  * removed NFQUEUE/QUEUE question in debconf, since a change here requires
    recompiling of the daemon with edits in the Makefile. (moblock-control,
    moblock.conf, debian/templates, debian/config, debian/postinst).
  * moblock-control:
    - fix logging when a blocklist fails to download while no backup is
      available.
    - fix output when moblock-control is called without arguments.
    - splitted test, if the deprecated configuration variables
      WHITE_IP_[IN|OUT|FORWARD] are used, in three separate tests.
    - insert iptables rule for "marked block" incoming packets always (when
      marking is on). This is useless for the unpatched MoBlock source, but
      makes development easier.
  * moblock-control, init, cron:
    - error/warning messages on testing variables tell if the variable is set in
      moblock.conf or moblock.default.
    - rewrote variable tests in init and cron
  * init, cron:
    - Tell on STDOUT how to configure MoBlock to not show warnings when
      automatic start/update is off.
  * moblock.conf:
    - move per default whitelisting of port 80 and 443 to moblock.conf, so this
      is default everywhere, not only in Debian.
  * patches:
    - updated all
    - 50_debianize:
      - remove most parts to make development easier
    - 80_mark_and_log.dpatch:
      - removed parts for mobloblock-control, iptables insertion
  * debian/control:
    - added transitional dummy package to update moblock-nfq to moblock

moblock (0.9~rc2-12) sid lenny; urgency=low

  * The have a look at the NEWS file release

  * debian/control, debian/postinst, debian/postrm, debian/templates,
    debian/config, debian/rules, debian/po/*:
    - added debconf support
    - always reload/update in postinst to make sure the selected blocklists are
      used.
    - in the Debian packages whitelist port 80 and 443 per default, thanks
      debconf ;-)
  * moblock-control, moblock.conf, allow.p2p, debian/install:
    - added support for allow lists in the PeerGuardian .p2p text format. This
      deprecates the variables WHITE_IP_[IN|OUT|FORWARD]. They can still be
      used but will be removed in a future version.
  * moblock-control, moblock.conf, moblock.if-up:
    - automatically whitelist traffic in the LAN and on the loopback device. For
      all interfaces that are up on "start" the inet addr will be whitelisted
      with subnetmask /24 (for 127.0.0.x the whole loopback interface will be
      whitelisted). The same will happen whenever an interface is brought up.
      Note that the latter will only work as long as the NEW traffic used to
      bring an interface up is not blocked by MoBlock.
    - new configuration variable WHITE_LOCAL, replacing old LOOPBACK
  * moblock-control:
    - added support for the deprecated iptables module QUEUE again. Note that
      the marking feature does not work with this. Use only if you have a kernel
      < 2.6.13.
    - added support for compressed (.7z, .gz, .zip) local blocklists, not only
      plain text ones
    - insert iptables rules for blocking marked-block packets at the head of the
      moblock_* chains instead of the head of the INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD chains.
    - use function for daemon status and its evaluation instead of code in
      several places. Therefore also better information in case of strange
      daemon status.
    - test most configuration variables every time moblock-control is called (as
      long as option is not "stop") instead of calling the tests in functions at
      several places of moblock-control.
    - added test if pidfile directory exists
    - added stats and reset_stats options (by cader <cade.robinson@gmail.com>)
    - also ignore commented lines in blocklists.list if they begin with
      whitespace: grep -E -v "^[:blank:]*#" FILE
    - on update after download explicitly check if blocklist already exists in
      BLOCKLISTS_DIR_USED, otherwise copy list there.
    - added option show_config to show the current settings
    - improved logging for module loading
    - syntax standardisations
    - removed bashisms:
      - $UID replaced with `id -ru`
      - $SINGLE_REMOVE with sed
      - kill with "-s"
    - when IFS is set to newline only use a real newline to do this instead of
      IFS=$'\n' because the latter seems not to work with dash. No idea how to
      do this properly.
  * logrotate:
    - removed bashisms: kill with "-s"
  * moblock-control, moblock.conf:
    - added configuration variable IPTABLES_MODULES, if turned off no kernel
      modules will be loaded. This allows iptables support built-in the kernel.
    - removed unused ACCEPT_[IN|OUT|FW] variables. No need to declare an
      iptables target here because marked unmatched packets are just not send to
      the moblock_* chains again.
    - added configuration variable LOG_IPTABLES to log matched packets to
      syslog. This allows to find out e.g. the port. Thanks cader 
      <cade.robinson@gmail.com>
  * moblock-control, moblock.conf, debian/postinst:
    - added new variable MASTER_BLOCKLIST_DIR, so that it is possible to have
      the master blocklist that is used by the moblock daemon in another
      directory then the rest of the configuration. For now, the path stays the
      same. Note that this is not related to the directories for downloading
      and storing successfully downloaded single blocklists (BLOCKLISTS_DIR and
      BLOCKLISTS_DIR_USED).
  * moblock-control, init, cron, debian/postinst:
    - error and exit if sourcing a configuration file fails although this file
      exists.
    - declare as /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash. Hopefully all bashisms removed.
  * debian/patches:
    - added 50_debianize.dpatch:
      - change moblock-control and moblock.conf to default to full Debian
        compatibility. So on Debian packages the default is full Debian
        compatibility, while in the separate moblock-control package LSB
        compatibility is the default. Note that LSB="1" is broken with the
        current (3.2-12) unmodified Debian LSB init-functions.
      - remove the copy of the non-LSB Debian LSB init-functions parts which is
        only needed for other distributions.
      - whitelist outgoing TCP ports 80 and 443 in moblock.conf, because this is
        the debconf default. General moblock-control default will stay with no
        default whitelisting.
    - added 80_mark_and_log.dpatch (replacing 81_MoBlock.c-logging_block.dpatch)
      for MoBlock.c and moblock-control:
      - adds mark-block feature also for INPUT.
      - strips "Blocked" from the logging, so that the logging doesn't claim
        too much if mark-block is used (instead of my previous distinguishing
        between "Blocked" and "Marked block" in
        81_MoBlock.c-logging_block.dpatch).
    - removed 82_MoBlock.c-logging_accept.dpatch
  [ - <not applied> 90_log.dpatch by cader <cade.robinson@gmail.com>.
      Use this patch instead of 80_mark_and_log.dpatch (edit in the Debian
      source package debian/patches/00list if you want to use it. Currently this
      breaks the logging part in mobloquer.
      - MoBlock.c backups MARKing OUT and FWD packets.
      - log ports and protocol in moblock.log
      - SIGUSR1 resets stats, too.
      - ll_log() function in rbt.c logs the IP range as well
      - I fixed rbt.c ll_clear() where it wasn't clearing a element in the
        list.  I am assuming because there is traffic coming in on that range.
        So I just set "hits" to 0 and then try the free().]
  * init.functions:
    - updated, based on Debian init.functions 3.2-12. This file does work with
      LSB="1".
  * added support for nfblockd daemon
  * reorganized packaging:
    - moved moblock-control stuff to an own folder.
    - created hard links to debian/ for changelog, cron.daily, init and
      logrotate, otherwise debhelper doesn't find them.
  * debian/control:
    - added Conflicts: nfblockd, iplist
    - bumped version to 3.8.0: remove copy of parts of init-funtions in
      moblock-control (50_debianize.dpatch) to satisfy policy 4.13.
    - added Depends:${misc:Depends}. This pulls e.g. debconf in.

      - on IPTABLES_ACTIVATION=0 insert the reject-"marked reject"-rule at the
        head of the moblock chains (instead of the INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD
        chains), to keep the latter untouched.
      - exit if any rule fails to be inserted.
      - specify the queue number. Fixes broken iptables insertion for nfqueue
        numbers other then 0.
    - delete_iptables:
      - if any iptables deletion failed explain what might be the reason.
    - build_blocklist:
      - exit with error if there are no blocklists to cat together.
    - print warning messages (if any operation is configured not to be
      executed) only if VERBOSITY="1". This makes the VERBOSITY setting
      consistent to the handling in cron and init.
  * minor documentation updates
  * logrotate:
    - send HUP signal to moblock only if PID exists not is false. Now really
      fixes error if moblock is not running.
  * debian/rules:
    - use xargs when chmod'ing the .sh files to avoid errors if theywhere
      deleted
  * debian/patches/8*_MoBlock.c*:
    - renewed, added explanations
  * debian/control:
    - bumped version to 3.7.3, no changes needed

moblock (0.9~rc2-7) sid; urgency=low

  * debian/postinst:
    - make default variables definitions, to have a fallback if they aren't in
      moblock.conf
    - minor changes
    - don't abort anymore if moblock.conf is not installed. Now really fixes
      "moblock uninstallable" if moblock.conf was deleted

moblock (0.9~rc2-6) sid; urgency=low

  * skipping one version number
  * cron.daily, init:
    - make default variables definitions, to have a fallback if they aren't in

    - removed checks if VERBOSITY is set in any way. Better checks for correct
      variables settings are needed sometimes. See BUGS.
    - don't abort anymore if moblock.conf is not installed. Fixes "moblock
      uninstallable" if moblock.conf was deleted

moblock (0.9~rc2-4) sid; urgency=low

  * moblock-control:
    - build_blocklist: remove a downloaded blocklist in the "used" directory if
      extracting fails. Reason: sometimes wget gives a return code 0 (success)
      for a incompletely downloaded blocklist which will then be copied to
      "used" erroneously. The cause for this may be that the Coral Cache node
      has a corrupt level1 blocklist in cache. Or did I miss a bug in the code?
    - use log_daemon_msg for output
    - start: moved all tests for sane variables settings to the beginning of
      the function
  * moblock-control, cron.daily, init:
    - Also output the path of moblock.default next to the path of moblock.conf
      on configuration errors.
  * logrotate:
    - send HUP signal to moblock only if PID exists. Fixes error if moblock is
      not running.
  * cron.daily, init:
    - don't warn when configured not to run if VERBOSITY is 0 or 2. Fixes
      unnecessary mail. Therefore a new setting VERBOSITY="2" in moblock.conf.
  * init:
    - fix script to only abort on "start" if moblock is configured not to start
      automatically (MOBLOCK_INIT="0"). So moblock will always stop on
      shutdown.
  * documentation:
    - minor updates, partly reformatted
    - fixed errors in moblock.conf regarding the defaults of init and cron
    - use a pure moblock man page and patch it to also consider moblock-control
  * copyright: updated

 -- jre <jre-phoenix@users.sourceforge.net>  Thu, 06 Mar 2008 21:46:43 +0100

moblock (0.9~rc2-3) sid; urgency=low

  * added option IPTABLES_TARGET_WHITELISTING in moblock.conf for the iptables
    target of whitelisted ports/IPs (per default RETURN as it was hardcoded
    previously)
  * fixed moblock options so that they don't contain -r/-a for REJECT/ACCEPT=0
    as it should be. So now the behaviour of MoBlock 0.8 (drop/accept directly)
    is really possible again.
  * added most variable definitions to moblock.conf. So porters can adjust the
    paths easily there. Of course the path of moblock.conf (CONTROL_CONF) still
    has to be specified in moblock-control, init and cron.
  * moblock-control test:
    - exit the test if MoBlock is not running
    - better differentiate the results
    - remove leading zeros only for ipfilter.dat blocklists, no more for lists
      in the p2p format. After removing leading zeros change ".." to ".0.".
      This is a fix for IPs which contain a real zero octet. For the bugreport
      see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4364654
    - better differentiate the results (check for grep error and always
      consider if packets are marked or dropped directly) and changed the
      wording of the results.
  * debian/control: emphasized warning about MoBlock blocking very much
  * repository: removed amd64 support until I've fixed that

      /tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1818886&group_id=162910&atid=825649)
    - applied patch 2223 by badfish99: "IPs logged with bytes reversed on

  * use multiple blocklists from bluetack.co.uk in peerguardian .p2p text

moblock (0.9~rc1-6) sid; urgency=low

  * moblock.conf:
    - added variables for logging to syslog and timestamping in the logfile.
    - Therefore removed DAEMON_OPTS here again, see below
  * moblock-control:
    - for LSB_MODE=0: start moblock with Debian specific "start-stop-daemon -b"
      and DAEMON_OPTS without "&". Otherwise keep old behaviour: lsb
      "start_daemon" with running moblock with "&" in the background. This
      seems to fix the "MoBlock fails to start the first time after installing/
      updating with aptitude" bug. Therefore moved the declaration of
      DAEMON_OPTS to a new place.
    - eventually missing function (log_end_msg) is always declared first now
      and will be overwritten by "init-functions" if it provides this function.
      (the configuration variable LSB_MODE is therefore no more needed for this)
    - applied (slightly changed) patch by hemisfear to optimize the IP_REMOVE.
      Thanks!
  * load default configuration (/etc/default/moblock) also in cron, init and
    postinst
  * postinst:
    - removed unnecessary LOG_DIR and CONTROL_LOG declaration
  * documentation updates

moblock (0.9~rc1-5) sid; urgency=low

  * moblock-control test: considers if packets get marked
  * moblock-control:
    - if "marking accept" send only new AND marked packets to the moblock 
      chains. Therefore no more RETURN of the marked packets in the chains
      necessary.
    - moved loopback traffic fix to the moblock_in and moblock_out chains with
      target RETURN instead of ACCEPT
  * moblock.conf:
    - added DAEMON_OPTS (before only directly in moblock-control), so that
      moblock's new logging options can be used (timestamping is already on by
      default, logging to syslog is now possible, logging to STDOUT doesn't
      work because moblock is started in the background)
    - values of variables are now all in double quotes ("") (except DAEMON_OPTS
      which is put in single quotes ('')) for better parsing by frontends like
      mobloquer
  * debian/control:
    - added mobloquer as suggests
    - replaces instead of conflicts moblock-nfq and moblock-ipq
    - removed versioned directory (moblock-0.8) from VCS links
    - updated description
  * debian/install: removed "moblock.default" line, this already works
    automatically. moblock.default is now installed as /etc/default/moblock
  * patches: compile without 82_MoBlock.c-logging_accept.dpatch
  * BUGS: newly introduced or noticed the first time: moblock was not running

moblock (0.9~rc1-3) sid; urgency=low

  * moblock-control test:

    - add a warning if packets are only marked and not dropped (because the
      test only checks the logfile, but doesn't know what really happened to
      the packet, unless there is a reply from the remote host).
  * insert iptables rules for marked packets always (not only on
    IPTABLES_ACTIVATION=1)
  * insert for "Marked accept" packages the target (default: RETURN) at the
    head of the moblock chains
  * minor manpage and documentation update

moblock (0.9~rc1-1) sid; urgency=low

  * New upstream code (0.9rc1 from CVS):
    - support for MARKing packets instead of DROPping or ACCEPTing
    - Integrated a patch from David Walluck for proper loading of p2b files
      (version 2)
    - command line options for logging to syslog, stdout and log
      timestamping (on per default in Debian packaging)
  * packaging:
    - updated debian packaging to version 3.7.2
    - only build single package: moblock (nfq version), deleted/renamed/
      edited Debian files accordingly
    - patches:
      - 30_makefile.dpatch (not in this version of sid and etch, but I don't
        want to make a clean release now):
        - only change CFLAGS, removed everything else
      - 70_MoBlock-nfq.sh.dpatch and 72_MoBlock-nfq-reject.sh.dpatch:
        - start moblock with our filenames
        - use ipfilter.dat as blocklist (like upstream)
      - 80_MoBlock.c-nfq_unbind_pf.dpatch (removed, since it's already in
        upstream source)
      - 81_MoBlock.c-logging_block.dpatch:
        - distinguish between "Blocked" and (new) "Marked block"
      - 82_MoBlock.c-logging_accept.dpatch:
        - also log "Accepted" and "Marked accepted" packets (for testing
          purposes)
  * added extra configuration variable for loopback whitelisting

moblock (0.8-33) sid; urgency=low

  * moblock-control port and IP whitelisting: The names of the conf variables
    have changed, the old ones aren't used anymore! Removed udp and tcp
    options, now always all protocols are whitelisted. This should solve many
    user problems and eases configuration. For special needs use custom
    iptables instead.
  * changed default blocklist to www.bluetack.co.uk/config/nipfilter.dat.gz
    because of bug 1818886 (https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=deta
    il&aid=1818886&group_id=162910&atid=825649). So also changed the configured
    blocklist format to ipfilter.dat (-d) instead of peerguardian .p2p text
    (-p) format!
  * moblock-control: automatically determine BLOCKLIST name according to the
    configured type in moblock.conf
  * moblock-control test:
    - also test blocklists in eMule ipfilter.dat format
    - take as TEST_IP the last IP from the first 10 lines to avoid problems
      with ping
  * moblock-control build_blocklist: log to logfile which lines will be removed
    (if IP_REMOVE is set in moblock.conf)
  * moblock-control: minor bugfixes
    - missing "log_failure_msg" entry
    - return code 6 on missing conf file

moblock (0.8-16~pre1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer. Many thanks to clessing on whose work I can build now!
  * IMPORTANT: new script /usr/bin/moblock-control for manual usage, cron and
    init. Configuration is done in /etc/moblock/moblock.conf and
    /etc/moblock/blocklists.list. Logfile is in /var/log/moblock-control.log
    Most files in debian/ changed.
  * blocklists.list:
    - added IANA lists
  * currently only adapted for nfq version - so ipq version is broken.
  * reverted MoBlock-ipq.sh + MoBlock-nfq.sh to upstream settings (without
    whitelisting) because they are no more used (moblock-control has 
    whitelisting for http and https on in the default setting)
  * debian/control:
    - depend on lsb-base (>= 3.0-6) instead of lsb-base (>= 3.0-3)
    - added unzip, p7zip | p7zip-full as recommends
    - removed gzip (essential package) and libnetfilter-queue1 (already
      inserted via ${shlibs:Depends})
    - moved wget from depends to recommends
    - changed description
  * debian/postinst:
    - removed "touch /etc/moblock/guarding.p2p". Currently the installation
      will abort if "moblock-control update" fails. So need for this.
  * added README.blocklists and NEWS.Debian
