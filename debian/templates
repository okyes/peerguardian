Template: blockcontrol/transition_moblock-control
Type: note
Default: true
_Description: New name blockcontrol. Fix your custom iptables scripts!
 moblock-control has been renamed to blockcontrol. Your configuration has been
 adapted. But if you use custom iptables rules
 (/etc/moblock/iptables-custom-insert.sh and iptables-custom-remove.sh), then
 you have to fix them, and move them to /etc/blockcontrol.
 .
 The iptables chains are now called blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and
 blockcontrol_fw.

Template: blockcontrol/warning_block
Type: note
_Description: WARNING: IP blockers may block your complete network/internet access!
 Blockcontrol starts an IP block daemon (MoBlock or NFBlock) automatically at
 system boot per default. Some preconfigured blocklists are updated once a day.
 Be warned, that blocklists may block more than what you want. In most cases
 this will result in a limited  network availability. This includes your own LAN
 and router, many webpages, services like eMail, instant messaging or the
 "weather applet" and your machine's accessibility from the internet.
 .
 There are many configuration options to prevent this. E.g. the default is to
 always allow (whitelist) LAN traffic, DNS server and loopback device. If you
 are on a public LAN, you probably want to disable this feature.
 .
 You can now tweak your settings. They can later be changed with
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure blockcontrol
 .
 For those who are stuck on this screen: Press the TAB key to select OK and
 press enter.

Template: blockcontrol/warning_firewall
Type: note
_Description: WARNING: Users with other firewall (iptables rules)
 If you use other firewalls or iptables rules, you have to take special care to
 avoid severe conflicts. Make sure the following three conditions hold:
  - The IP block daemon marks non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets.
    (The marking feature is on per default, so don't worry about that.)
  - Other firewalls do not mark packets.
  - blockcontrol is started after other firewalls. If other firewalls are
    started/reloaded after blockcontrol, then you need to restart blockcontrol
    again, if the other firewall messed up blockcontrol's iptables setup.
 .
 So avoid severe misconfigurations by always doing a
  blockcontrol restart
 whenever you have started or stopped or changed the configuration of your other
 firewall application.
 .
 You can check your iptables rules with
  iptables -L -nv
 or
  blockcontrol status.

Template: blockcontrol/BLOCKLIST_FORMAT
Type: select
Choices: eMule ipfilter.dat format, PeerGuardian .p2b v2 binary format, PeerGuardian .p2p text format
Default: PeerGuardian .p2p text format
_Description: Set the blocklist format:
 Configuration variable: BLOCKLIST_FORMAT
 .
 Set the format of the blocklists that you use. All your blocklists have to be
 in this format.
 .
  eMule ipfilter.dat format:
   MoBlock option: -d
   Example line:

Template: blockcontrol/LOG_TIMESTAMP
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Turn on timestamping in the logfile?
 Configuration variable: LOG_TIMESTAMP
 .
 This lets the MoBlock daemon add timestamps to the logging.

Template: blockcontrol/LOG_SYSLOG
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Turn on daemon logging to syslog?
 Configuration variable: LOG_SYSLOG
 .
 This lets the MoBlock daemon also log to syslog.
 .
 If you want to turn off the daemon's logging to the logfile, you can set
  DAEMON_LOG=""
 in /etc/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf. Please note that "test" will not work then.


Template: blockcontrol/LOG_IPTABLES
Type: select
Choices: Do not log blocked packets to syslog., Log blocked packets to syslog., Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: Do not log blocked packets to syslog.
_Description: Turn on iptables logging of blocked packets to syslog?
 Configuration variable: LOG_IPTABLES
 .
 If you choose to log blocked packets to syslog, an iptables rule with the
 target "LOG --log-level info" for "marked block" packets will be inserted
 directly before the iptables rule which decides what happens to "marked block"
 packets.
 .
 This will only work if you mark matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets. (The
 marking feature is on per default. It will be explained and asked for later.)
 .
 This is one way to figure out the port of the blocked packets.
 
 The default is not to log blocked packets to syslog.

Template: blockcontrol/VERBOSITY
Type: select
Choices: Output to STDOUT is off (only errors will be reported)., Output to STDOUT is on., Output to STDOUT is on but no warning will be shown if an operation is configured not to be executed.
Default: Output to STDOUT is on.
_Description: Set the verbosity of blockcontrol:
 Configuration variable: VERBOSITY
 .
 This only affects the output to STDOUT by blockcontrol, cron and init.
 This does not affect logging or the output of the IP block daemon.
 .
  0 - Output to STDOUT is off (only errors will be reported).
  1 - Output to STDOUT is on. (default)
  2 - Output to STDOUT is on but no warning will be shown
      if an operation is configured not to be executed.

Template: blockcontrol/INIT
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Turn on automatic start?
 Configuration variable: INIT
 .
 "No" prevents the init script from starting on "start". Therefore the IP block
 daemon will not be started at system boot. The same behaviour can be achieved
 by removing/tweaking the init file and the links pointing to it. You can do
 this manually or by using an application such as rcconf.

Template: blockcontrol/CRON
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Turn on automatic blocklist update?
 Configuration variable: CRON
 .
 This sets if the daily cron job updates the blocklists.

Template: blockcontrol/WD
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Enable watchdog to monitor your IP blocker?
 Configuration variable: WD
 .
 The watchdog checks in regular intervals (per default 5 minutes) if some of
 the necessary iptables rules exist and if the daemon is responsive. If one of
 these tests fails, it restarts blockcontrol.
 .
 This is especially useful, if you have other firewall applications running,
 because they often mess up the iptables rules, which can be fixed by restarting
 blockcontrol. Unfortunately this manual action is often forgotten.

Template: blockcontrol/NFQUEUE_NUMBER
Type: string
Default: 92
_Description: Set the NFQUEUE queue number:
 Configuration variable: NFQUEUE_NUMBER
 .
 Valid queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 92.
 .
 Insert the plain number as you would give it in an iptables command after
 "--queue-num". Do not use surrounding "quotes".

Template: blockcontrol/IPTABLES_SETTINGS
Type: select
Choices: Do not set any iptables rules. You or another script/firewall has to do this!, Use separate iptables chains., Only set custom iptables rules.
Default: Use separate iptables chains.
_Description: Set how traffic is sent to the IP block daemon:
 Configuration variable: IPTABLES_SETTINGS
 .
 The default is to place MoBlock's iptables rules in separate iptables chains
 (blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw).
 .
 You can set custom iptables rules in
 /etc/blockcontrol/iptables-custom-insert.sh and iptables-custom-remove.sh.
 These scripts are executed either additionally to the default iptables rules
 insertion/removal or exclusively.

Template: blockcontrol/IPTABLES_ACTIVATION
Type: select
Choices: Do nothing. You or another script/firewall has to do this!, Send all NEW traffic to the iptables chains., Send all traffic to the iptables chains.
Default: Send all NEW traffic to the iptables chains.
_Description: Activate the iptables chains?
 Configuration variable: IPTABLES_ACTIVATION
 .
 Decide what traffic shall be checked by the IP block daemon. If you previously
 decided to use separate iptables chains, then it is a good idea to send all NEW
 traffic there. It is absolutely safe to only check NEW traffic.
 .
 Checking all (not only NEW) traffic might cause problems, because the IP block
 daemon has to check much more traffic then. Further whitelisting gets more
 complicated, since you have to think of both directions, incoming and outgoing.
 Only do this, if you are sure that you want to.
 .
 The iptables rules that activate the iptables chains are inserted at the head
 of the chains INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD.

Template: blockcontrol/REJECT
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to mark matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets?
 Configuration variable: REJECT
 .
 Set what happens to matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets.
 .
 If you MARK matched packets, then further iptables rules that match this MARK
 decide what happens to the packets. E.g. this allows to REJECT packets to avoid
 the long timeout which occurs when packets are DROPped, see below. This setting
 is also necessary for iptables logging to syslog, see above. (default)
 .
 If you do not MARK matched packets, they will be DROPped directly.

Template: blockcontrol/REJECT_IN
Type: select
Choices: REJECT, DROP, Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: DROP
_Description: Set the iptables target for "marked block" incoming packets:
 Configuration variable: REJECT_IN
 .
 REJECT: The sender of the packet is notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 DROP: The sender of the packet is not notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/REJECT_OUT
Type: select
Choices: REJECT, DROP, Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: REJECT
_Description: Set the iptables target for "marked block" outgoing packets:
 Configuration variable: REJECT_OUT
 .
 REJECT: The sender of the packet is notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 DROP: The sender of the packet is not notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/REJECT_FW
Type: select
Choices: REJECT, DROP, Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: DROP
_Description: Set the iptables target for "marked block" forwarded packets:
 Configuration variable: REJECT_FW
 .
 REJECT: The sender of the packet is notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 DROP: The sender of the packet is not notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/ACCEPT
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to mark non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets?
 Configuration variable: ACCEPT
 .
 Set what happens to non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets.
 .
 If you MARK non-matched packets, then they will be just ignored by
 blockcontrol. This allows integration with other firewalls. (default)
 .
 If you do not MARK non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets, they will
 be ACCEPTed directly.

Template: blockcontrol/info_whitelisting
Type: note
_Description: Whitelisting
 The following questions help you define which traffic will NOT be checked by
 the IP block daemon. This is called "whitelisting".
 .
 Do a "dpkg-reconfigure blockcontrol" to get the full set of questions (many have
 only low priority and will not be asked per default).
 .
 Traffic is categorized as:
  incoming:
  someone from the internet wants to access your machine
  outgoing:
  you want to access someone on the internet, e.g. websurfing
  forward:
  traffic passes your machine, e.g. because it is a router
  or runs virtual machine software such as VirtualBox.

Template: blockcontrol/WHITE_TCP_OUT
Type: string
Default: http https
_Description: Whitelist outgoing TCP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_TCP_OUT
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port ranges
 are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be specified. A
 port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Common ports:
   80 - http
  443 - https
   22 - ssh
  993 - SSL IMAP
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/WHITE_UDP_OUT
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist outgoing UDP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_UDP_OUT
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
 specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/WHITE_TCP_IN
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist incoming TCP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_TCP_IN
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
 specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/WHITE_UDP_IN
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist incoming UDP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_UDP_IN
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
 specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/WHITE_TCP_FORWARD
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist forwarded TCP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_TCP_FORWARD
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
 specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/WHITE_UDP_FORWARD
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist forwarded UDP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_UDP_FORWARD
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
 specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: blockcontrol/WHITE_LOCAL
Type: select
Choices: No automatic whitelisting., Automatic whitelisting of LAN and DNS server and loopback device., Automatic whitelisting of DNS server and loopback device.
Default: Automatic whitelisting of LAN and DNS server and loopback device.
_Description: Set the automatic whitelisting options:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_LOCAL
 .
 The default is to automatically whitelist LAN, DNS server and loopback device.
 This is the recommended setting if you are at home.
 .
 If you are on a public LAN, you probably want it checked by the IPblocker. So
 choose to only whitelist the DNS server and the loopback device then.

Template: blockcontrol/allowlist
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Add a line to the allowlist:
 Any value given here will be added to the allow list (per default this is
 /etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p). Lines in the allow list must be in the PeerGuardian
 .p2p text format:
   Some organization:1.0.0.0-1.255.255.255
 .
 This is also true if your blocklists are in another format.
 .
 You can whitelist more IP ranges by adding them to /etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p.

Template: blockcontrol/IP_REMOVE
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Remove lines from the blocklist:
 Configuration variable: IP_REMOVE
 .
 Remove lines from the blocklist matching the specified pattern (the search
 pattern is case-insensitive).
 .
 Seperate patterns with a semicolon ";". Do not use surrounding "quotes".
 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.
 .
 Example:
  google;yahoo;altavista;debian;sourceforge
 .
 Warning for beginners: If you want to whitelist a special IP then use the
 allowlist. If you specify an IP here you will most likely fail.
