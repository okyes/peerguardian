Template: moblock/warning_block
Type: note
_Description: WARNING: MoBlock may block your complete network/internet access!
 MoBlock starts automatically at system boot per default. Some preconfigured
 blocklists are updated once a day. Be warned, that MoBlock will not only block
 many unwanted IPs, but in most cases running MoBlock will result in a limited
 network availability. This includes your own LAN and router, many webpages,
 services like eMail, instant messaging or the "weather applet" and your
 machine's accessibility from the internet.
 .
 There are many configuration options to prevent this. Per default traffic to
 your own LAN will always be allowed (whitelisted). This feature is still
 experimental. If you are on a public LAN, you probably want to disable this
 feature.
 .
 You can now tweak MoBlock's behaviour.
 .
 These settings can later be changed with
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure blockcontrol

Template: moblock/warning_firewall
Type: note
_Description: WARNING: Users with firewall (iptables rules)
 Since version 0.9, MoBlock no longer conflicts with other firewalls. Make sure
 the following three conditions hold:
  - MoBlock marks non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist)
    packets. (The marking feature is on per default. It
    will be explained and asked for later.)
  - Other firewalls do not mark packets.
  - MoBlock is started after other firewalls. If other
    firewalls are started/reloaded after MoBlock, then you
    need to restart MoBlock again. You will be fine, if the
    iptables rules which send traffic to MoBlock's iptables
    chains (blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw) stand
    before all other iptables rules which ACCEPT traffic.
 .
 You can check your iptables rules with
  iptables -L -nv
 or
  blockcontrol status.

Template: moblock/BLOCKLIST_FORMAT
Type: select
Choices: eMule ipfilter.dat format, PeerGuardian .p2b v2 binary format, PeerGuardian .p2p text format
Default: PeerGuardian .p2p text format
_Description: Set the blocklist format:
 Configuration variable: BLOCKLIST_FORMAT

Template: moblock/LOG_TIMESTAMP
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Turn on timestamping in the logfile?
 Configuration variable: LOG_TIMESTAMP
 .
 This lets the MoBlock daemon add timestamps to the logging.

Template: moblock/LOG_SYSLOG
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Turn on daemon logging to syslog?
 Configuration variable: LOG_SYSLOG
 .
 This lets the MoBlock daemon also log to syslog.
 .
 If you want to turn off the daemon's logging to the logfile, you can set
  DAEMON_LOG=""
 in /etc/default/blockcontrol. Please note that "test" will not work then.


Template: moblock/LOG_IPTABLES
Type: select
Choices: Do not log blocked packets to syslog., Log blocked packets to syslog., Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: Do not log blocked packets to syslog.
_Description: Turn on iptables logging of blocked packets to syslog?
 Configuration variable: LOG_IPTABLES
 .
 If you choose to log blocked packets to syslog, an iptables rule with the
 target "LOG --log-level info" for "marked block" packets will be inserted
 directly before the iptables rule which decides what happens to "marked block"
 packets.
 .
 This will only work if you mark matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets. (The
 marking feature is on per default. It will be explained and asked for later.)
 .
 The default is not to log blocked packets to syslog.

Template: moblock/VERBOSITY
Type: select
Choices: Output to STDOUT is off (only errors will be reported)., Output to STDOUT is on., Output to STDOUT is on but no warning will be shown if an operation is configured not to be executed.
Default: Output to STDOUT is on.
_Description: Set the verbosity of blockcontrol:
 Configuration variable: VERBOSITY
 .
 This only affects the output to STDOUT by blockcontrol, cron and init.
 This does not affect logging or the output of the MoBlock daemon.
 .
  0 - Output to STDOUT is off (only errors will be reported).
  1 - Output to STDOUT is on. (default)
  2 - Output to STDOUT is on but no warning will be shown
      if an operation is configured not to be executed.

Template: moblock/INIT
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Turn on automatic start?
 Configuration variable: INIT
 .
 "No" prevents the MoBlock init script from starting on "start". Therefore
 MoBlock will not be started at system boot. The same behaviour can be achieved
 by removing/tweaking the init file and the links pointing to it. You can do
 this manually or by using an application such as rcconf.

Template: moblock/CRON
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Turn on automatic blocklist update?
 Configuration variable: CRON
 .
 This sets if the daily MoBlock cron job updates the blocklists.

Template: moblock/NFQUEUE_NUMBER
Type: string
Default: 92
_Description: Set the NFQUEUE queue number:
 Configuration variable: NFQUEUE_NUMBER
 .
 Valid queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 92.
 .
 Insert the plain number as you would give it in an iptables command after
 "--queue-num". Do not use surrounding "quotes".

Template: moblock/IPTABLES_SETTINGS
Type: select
Choices: Do not set any iptables rules. You or another script/firewall has to do this!, Use separate iptables chains for MoBlock., Only set custom iptables rules.
Default: Use separate iptables chains for MoBlock.
_Description: Set how traffic is sent to MoBlock:
 Configuration variable: IPTABLES_SETTINGS
 .
 The default is to place MoBlock's iptables rules in separate iptables chains
 (blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw).
 .
 You can set custom iptables rules in /etc/blockcontrol/iptables-custom-insert.sh
 and iptables-custom-remove.sh. These scripts are executed either additionally
 to the default iptables rules insertion/removal or exclusively.

Template: moblock/IPTABLES_ACTIVATION
Type: select
Choices: Do nothing. You or another script/firewall has to do this!, Send all NEW traffic to the iptables chains of MoBlock., Send all traffic to the iptables chains of MoBlock.
Default: Send all NEW traffic to the iptables chains of MoBlock.
_Description: Activate MoBlock's iptables chains?
 Configuration variable: IPTABLES_ACTIVATION
 .
 Decide what traffic shall be checked by MoBlock. If you previously decided to
 use MoBlock's separate iptables chains, then it is a good idea to send all NEW
 traffic there. It is absolutely safe to only check NEW traffic.
 .
 Checking all (not only NEW) traffic might cause problems because MoBlock has to
 check much more traffic then. Further whitelisting gets more complicated, since
 you have to think of both directions, incoming and outgoing. Only do this, if
 you are sure that you want to.
 .
 The iptables rules that activate the iptables chains of MoBlock are inserted at
 the head of the chains INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD.

Template: moblock/REJECT
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to mark matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets?
 Configuration variable: REJECT
 .
 Set what happens to matched (IP is in the blocklist) packets.
 .
 No, DROP them directly (as in MoBlock 0.8).
 .
 Yes, MARK them. Further iptables rules that match this MARK decide what happens
 to them. E.g. this allows to REJECT packets to avoid the long timeout which
 occurs when packets are DROPped, see below. This setting is also necessary for
 iptables logging to syslog, see above. (default)

Template: moblock/REJECT_IN
Type: select
Choices: REJECT, DROP, Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: DROP
_Description: Set the iptables target for "marked block" incoming packets:
 Configuration variable: REJECT_IN
 .
 REJECT: The sender of the packet is notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 DROP: The sender of the packet is not notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: moblock/REJECT_OUT
Type: select
Choices: REJECT, DROP, Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: REJECT
_Description: Set the iptables target for "marked block" outgoing packets:
 Configuration variable: REJECT_OUT
 .
 REJECT: The sender of the packet is notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 DROP: The sender of the packet is not notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: moblock/REJECT_FW
Type: select
Choices: REJECT, DROP, Do not touch my settings. Use the current custom value instead.
Default: DROP
_Description: Set the iptables target for "marked block" forwarded packets:
 Configuration variable: REJECT_FW
 .
 REJECT: The sender of the packet is notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 DROP: The sender of the packet is not notified that the packet was blocked.
 .
 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: moblock/ACCEPT
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to mark non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets?
 Configuration variable: ACCEPT
 .
 Set what happens to non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets.
 .
 No, ACCEPT them directly (as in MoBlock 0.8).
 .
 Yes, MARK them. MoBlock will then ignore them. This allows integration with
 other firewalls. (default)

Template: moblock/info_whitelisting
Type: note
_Description: Whitelisting
 The following questions help you define which traffic will NOT be checked by
 MoBlock. This is called "whitelisting".
 .
 Do a "dpkg-reconfigure moblock" to get the full set of questions (many have
 only low priority and will not be asked per default).
 .
 Traffic is categorized as:
  incoming:
  someone from the internet wants to access your machine
  outgoing:
  you want to access someone on the internet, e.g. websurfing
  forward:
  traffic passes your machine, e.g. because it is a router
  or an emulator such as Virtualbox XP

Template: moblock/WHITE_TCP_OUT

 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: moblock/WHITE_UDP_IN
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist incoming UDP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_UDP_IN
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
 specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: moblock/WHITE_TCP_FORWARD
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist forwarded TCP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_TCP_FORWARD
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be
 specified. A port range (port:port) counts as two ports.
 .
 Seperate multiple entries with whitespace (" "). Do not use surrounding
 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: moblock/WHITE_UDP_FORWARD
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Whitelist forwarded UDP ports:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_UDP_FORWARD
 .
 Whitelist ports by port number or with the associated service name. Port
 ranges are specified in the format "port:port". Up to 15 ports can be

 "quotes". Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.

Template: moblock/WHITE_LOCAL
Type: select
Choices: Do nothing., Automatically whitelist LAN traffic and traffic on the loopback device., Whitelist the loopback device.
Default: Automatically whitelist LAN traffic and traffic on the loopback device.
_Description: Set your whitelisting options for local traffic:
 Configuration variable: WHITE_LOCAL
 .
 The default is to automatically whitelist LAN traffic and traffic on the
 loopback device. This feature is still experimental. If you are on a public
 LAN, you probably want to only whitelist the loopback device instead.
 .
 "Whitelist the loopback device" is the same as the obsolete setting
 LOOPBACK="1".

Template: moblock/allowlist
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Add a line to the allowlist:
 Any value given here will be added to the allow list (per default this is
 /etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p). Lines in the allow list must be in the PeerGuardian
 .p2p text format:
   Some organization:1.0.0.0-1.255.255.255
 .
 This is also true if your blocklists are in another format.
 .
 You can whitelist more IP ranges by adding them to /etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p.

Template: moblock/IP_REMOVE
Type: string
Default: 
_Description: Remove lines from the blocklist:
 Configuration variable: IP_REMOVE
 .
 Remove lines from the blocklist matching the specified pattern (the search
 pattern is case-insensitive).
 .

 Be careful: senseless values are also accepted.
 .
 Example:
  google;yahoo;altavista;debian;sourceforge
 .
 Warning for beginners: If you want to whitelist a special IP then use the
 allowlist. If you specify an IP here you will most likely fail.
