Description:

blockcontrol is designed to do all tasks related to IP block daemons (MoBlock
or NFBlock). They check internet traffic based on large lists of IP address
ranges in order to protect your privacy. You can get them at
http://moblock.berlios.de and
http://sites.google.com/site/makovick/nfblockd-daemon

WARNING: IP blockers may block your complete network/internet access!

blockcontrol starts automatically at system boot per default. Some preconfigured
blocklists are updated once a day. Be warned: this will not only block many
unwanted IPs, but in most cases this will result in a limited network
availability. This includes your own LAN and router, many webpages, services
like eMail, instant messaging or the "weather applet" and your
machine's accessibility from the internet.

There are many configuration options to prevent this. Per default traffic to
your own LAN will always be allowed (whitelisted). If you are on a public LAN,
you probably want to disable this feature.


WARNING: Users with firewall (iptables rules)

MoBlock (since version 0.9) and NFBlock do not conflict with other firewalls.
Make sure the following three conditions hold:
  - The IP block daemon marks non-matched (IP is not in the blocklist) packets.
    (The marking feature is on per default.)
  - Other firewalls do not mark packets.
  - blockcontrol is started after other firewalls. If other firewalls are
    started/reloaded after blockcontrol, then you need to restart blockcontrol
    again. You will be fine, if the iptables rules which send traffic to the
    iptables chains (blockcontrol_in, blockcontrol_out and blockcontrol_fw)
    stand before all other iptables rules which ACCEPT traffic.


Technical note:

The IP block daemons check traffic (packets) that is sent to the iptables
NFQUEUE (or the deprecated QUEUE) target. If the necessary support is not built
in the kernel directly, blockcontrol will load the necessary kernel modules.
Up to MoBlock 0.8 packets that do not match the blocklist are ACCEPTed and
packets that match the blocklist are DROPped.
MoBlock (since 0.9) and NFBlock can also MARK packets, so that iptables rules
that match this mark decide what happens with these packets. Per default
marking is on: allowed packets (IP is not in the blocklist) get the mark "20"
(shown as 0x14 by iptables) and blocked packets (IP is in the blocklist) get the
mark "10" (0xa).
Marked packets repeat the hook function (NF_REPEAT). So they are sent back to
the head of the iptables chain again. A packet may only bear one mark, so there
mustn't be any other applications / iptables rules that mark packets. Otherwise
the setup will not work and packets will loop forever.
"Marked block" outgoing packets will be REJECTED, "Marked block" incoming and 
forwarded packets will be DROPped. "Marked accept" packets will be ignored, so
other iptables rules decide what happens to them.

================================================================================

Features:

- Start and stop IP block daemon. Or let init do this automatically.
- Update your blocklist from online sources and local blocklists. Or let cron do
  this automatically on a regular basis. Keep backups if anything goes wrong.
- Examine your selected blocklists by searching the single blocklists for
  keywords.
- Remove lines by keyword from the blocklists.
- Handle your iptables rules: use a default setup, easily allow all traffic on
  specific ports and use an allow list, or add your own sophisticated iptables
  rules.
- Allow all LAN traffic automatically. If you are on a public LAN, you probably
  want to disable this feature.
- Check the status and test the IP block daemon.
- Detects if kernel modules are needed and loads them if necessary.
- Set verbosity and logging options.
- Provides LSB 3.1 compatible init script.
- Daily rotation of the logfiles.

================================================================================

Usage:

blockcontrol OPTION

================================================================================

Options:

start
  inserts iptables rules and starts the IP block daemon. If the blocklist
  configuration changed rebuild the master blocklist.

stop
  deletes iptables rules and stops the IP block daemon.

restart
  restarts the IP block daemon.

reload
  rebuilds the master blocklist and reloads the IP block daemon if it is
  running.

update
  updates the blocklists, rebuilds the master blocklist and reloads the IP block
  daemon.

status
  gives the iptables settings and the status of the IP block daemon.

test
  does a simple test to check if the IP block daemon is working (pings a random
  IP in the blocklist and checks if this IP was logged in the block daemons
  logfile and if it answered).

search
  Outputs the occurences of a keyword and the names of the single blocklists.

stats
  reports MoBlock's statistics.

reset_stats
  resets MoBlock's statistics.

show_config
  shows the current configuration settings.

Note for blocklist operations: When the master blocklist is built, missing
single blocklists are downloaded. If any blocklist fails to download, and if
there is no old version available, the operation aborts. If a downloaded
blocklist fails to extract, it is deleted and the operation aborts.


================================================================================

Configuration:

Blocklists are configured in blocklists.list
(/etc/blockcontrol/blocklists.list).

The allow list for IP ranges is allow.p2p (/etc/blockcontrol/allow.p2p). Per
default, the allowlist is used for incoming and outgoing connections. If desired
different allow lists for incoming, outgoing and forward connections may be
used.

The rest is done in blockcontrol.conf (/etc/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf).
Have a look at blockcontrol.defaults
(/usr/lib/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.defaults) for the complete and commented
set of possible configuration variables.

================================================================================

Files:

- blockcontrol (required)
  The shell script blockcontrol. Must be executable.

- blockcontrol.main (required)
  The core of all executable scripts. Must be executable.
  Referenced as CONTROL_MAIN in blockcontrol, init, cron.daily and if.up.

- blockcontrol.defaults (required)
  Default settings for all variables and pathnames.
  Referenced as CONTROL_DEFAULTS in blockcontrol.main.

- blockcontrol.lib (required)
  Library for blockcontrol.main.

- blocklists.list (required)
  Lists all blocklists that are used (and downloaded) by blockcontrol for
  use by the IP block daemon.

- blockcontrol.conf
  The user configuration file for blockcontrol.

- allow.p2p
  Allow list which contains IP ranges that shall be whitelisted.

- if-up
  Gets executed whenever a network interface is brought up to make sure that
  the automatic whitelisting of traffic in the LAN does work. Must be
  executable.

- iptables-custom-insert.sh (optional)
  Script to insert custom iptables rules. This script will be executed on every
  "blockcontrol start", if IPTABLES_SETTINGS="1" or "2" is configured.

- iptables-custom-remove.sh (optional)
  Script to delete custom iptables rules. See above.

- init (optional)
  Init file for starting the IP block daemon automatically on every bootup. Must
  be executable.

- cron.daily (optional)
  Cron file for updating the blocklists automatically with cron. Must be
  executable.

- logrotate (optional, configuration file for logrotate)
  Debian place: /etc/logrotate.d/blockcontrol
  Assumes logfile in /var/log/blockcontrol.log
  Note: You should add another logrotate for the IP block daemon, too! Download
  one from: http://moblock-deb.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/moblock-deb/moblock/mo
  block-0.9~rc2/moblock-0.9~rc2/debian/logrotate

- docs/
  Some documentatation. blockcontrol.1 is a man page.

- debian/
  You don't need this, this is only needed for the Debian packages.

The following directories/files will be created on usage (path examples for
Debian, configurable in blockcontrol.conf):

- /var/spool/blockcontrol
  The single blocklists are downloaded and manipulated in subfolders of this
  folder.

- /var/log/blockcontrol.log + rotated logs
  The logfile of the blockcontrol script. This file contains amongst other
  things about starting/stopping the IP block daemon and updating the
  blocklists.

- /var/log/moblock.log + rotated logs
  The logfile of the MoBlock daemon. NFBlock uses /var/log/syslog.

- /var/lib/blockcontrol/guarding.p2p + backup or
  /var/lib/blockcontrol/guarding.p2b + backup or
  /var/lib/blockcontrol/ipfilter.dat + backup
  The master blocklist used by the IP block daemon depending on the used format.

================================================================================

Installation:

There's a simple Makefile, which will install blockcontrol in fileplaces as
under Debian. This should be the same as defined by the File Hierarchy Standard
(FHS). If this fits for you, simply type

  make install

If you choose other file places, you have to adjust:

- the path to blockcontrol.main (CONTROL_MAIN) in blockcontrol, if-up,
  cron.daily and init.
- the path to blockcontrol.defaults (CONTROL_DEFAULTS) in blockcontrol.main
- PATH in blockcontrol.defaults. Either moblock or nfblock have to be installed
  in PATH.
- all other paths in blockcontrol.defaults
- the Makefile

If your system doesn't have the LSB init-funtions (/lib/lsb/init-functions),
then hardcoded fallback functions will be used. (new since blockcontrol 1.3)

Note for Fedora 7 and CentOS 5 users (broken LSB init-functions):
http://forums.phoenixlabs.org/showpost.php?p=107810&postcount=22

blockcontrol will detect if you have installed moblock or nfblock (in PATH as
specified in blockcontrol.defaults) automatically. Otherwise you can specify
this in blockcontrol.conf (/usr/lib/blockcontrol/blockcontrol.conf).

================================================================================

Supported systems:

blockcontrol was written and tested under Debian Lenny. However it should run
under every Linux distribution or other POSIX compliant systems.

================================================================================

Requirements:

- iptables
- wget (optional, needed for blocklists update)
- /usr/bin/printf (optional, needed during "update" for archive type detection)
- p7zip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .7z)
- unzip (optional, needed for blocklists packed as .zip)
- awk, sed, grep, basename, dirname, cat, cd, mv, cp, zcat, md5sum
  (those should really be on every system)
- netfilter kernel support (either as modules or directly built in the kernel)
  These are the modules that are loaded here (The list was compiled with
  lsmod|grep -E "x_|xt_|ip"|grep -Ev "cipher|^ip6|^ipv6"|sort . Note that
  xt_ may be named ip_ or ipt_ on older systems.):
