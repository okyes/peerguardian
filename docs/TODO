TODO for blockcontrol and MoBlock debian packaging

blockcontrol:

- add option to temp allow (blockcontrol allow IP and blockcontrol allow-MM IP),
  which inserts the appropriate iptables rules directly.

- add configuration possibility to shut off checking for specific chains
  (FORWARD).

- check how NFBlock works with marking on/off.

- explicitly stop/start moblock and nfblock in their own packages.
  But there's still a bug:
  Can't switch from moblock to nfblock (and vice versa!?) without rebooting,
  because else nfblock can't bind to NFQUEUE.
  (nfblockd: Error during nfq_bind_pf(): Illegal seek).
  See BUGS

- add support for moblock -z NFQUEUE length from patch 41_Patch_2589_All
  ow__nfq_set_queue_maxlen__to_be_increased_from_default.dpatch

- send error messages to console and logfile. [João]

- implement options of NFBlock (no-dbus)

- improve makefile:
  - add (something like) "configure" to configure paths.
  - read installation paths from blockcontrol.defaults and blockcontrol.conf,
    special handling of blockcontrol.main and blockcontrol.defaults needed,
    because they are not in the previous files.

- fix debconf to use debian/config again.

- [DISCUSS] Block IPv6 completely because currently only IPv4 is checked?

- add blocklist conversion to UTF8 (code already implemented, but not used. Use
  better checks). Wait for blocklist converter by João instead.

- expand test to also use traceroute (with a timeout)

- build_blocklist: disable concatenating blocklists in .p2b (binary) format.
  Abort (?) if several binary lists are used, MoBlock can't cope with this. What
  about nfblock?

- adapt test function for peerguardian .p2b v2 binary format blocklist formats.


Requests for upstream:

- [moblock]:  check if blocklists are in the correct format. Or better:
  automatic detection of format + possibility to use several blocklists at once.

- [moblock]: use a real allowlist (instead of the iptables whitelisting)

- [iblocklist.com]: This site renames some filenames. So it is not possible to
  use the upstream URL and the iblocklist.com URL, and avoid the second download
  with wget's timestamp option.
