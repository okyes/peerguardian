BUGS of blockcontrol and moblock-deb packages:

################################## Open bugs: ##################################

- Can't switch from moblock to nfblock (and vice versa!?) without rebooting,
  because else nfblock can't bind to NFQUEUE.
  (nfblockd: Error during nfq_bind_pf(): Illegal seek).
  See TODO and nfblock patch.

- blockcontrol (1.3) if-up:
  check for already whitelisted LAN does not work for all subnetmasks
  -
  The check if a LAN is already whitelisted, will only work for the subnetmasks
  255.255.255.0 and 255.255.0.0. Else a new whitelisting rule will be inserted
  in any case, so there may be multiple identical rules.

- blockcontrol can't verify if IP block daemon is really started

  MoBlock is started in the background. So a successful start is reported before
  this is really the case. If MoBlock crashes this will stay unnoticed.

  NFBlock is started as a daemon. But still a successful start is reported
  before NFBlock binds to nfq. (bug upstream)

  blockcontrol.watchdog partly solves this (2009-05-03).

############################# (Major) closed bugs: #############################

- <SOLVED in blockcontrol 1.0-1>
  debconf doesn't work as expected. Debconf runs twice during installation:
  first it asks questions and then it overwrites the answers with the not-yet
  modified configuration files.
  Further the debconf database is not cleared properly on purge.

  Solution: move all stuff from debian/config to debian/postinst.

- <SOLVED in 0.9~rc1-6 and 0.8-40> MoBlock fails to start after install/update
  -
  I frequently have the problem that after updating moblock with aptitude
  moblock was not running (no pid, no process). moblock.log stated:
  "Error opening , aborting...".
  "blockcontrol restart" solves this.

  A test with MoBlock 0.8-39 showed: the process was dead, but the pidfile
  existed. Restarting also solved this...

  Solution:
  On Debian start MoBlock with Debian specific "start-stop-daemon -b"
  and DAEMON_OPTS without "&" instead of the LSB way.

  Have a look for bugs in the init.functions :-/

  Note that blockcontrol can't verify if MoBlock is really started, since
  MoBlock is started in the background. See separate bug of 2008-01-21.
