blockcontrol (0.8-15jre)

  * initial release for moblock (*only nfq*)

  [ changes to peerguardnf init & update script: ]
  * restructured: main script is /usr/bin/blockcontrol.
     cron and init source the main script
  * scripts are now #!/bin/bash instead of #!/bin/sh. Not sure if this is
    necessary. Tests with other shells are welcome.
  * blockcontrol:
    - added option "reload", same as "force-reload":
       rebuilds blocklist and reloads moblock
    - paths to external applications no more hardcoded in script
    - fewer PATHs set
  * blockcontrol and default:
    new configuration variables instead of IPTABLES=
    - IPTABLES_SETTINGS: Defines how traffic is sent to moblock
        (removed uncommon alternatives, tell me if you need them)
    - IPTABLES_ACTIVATION: defines if and when traffic is sent to moblock
    - IPTABLES_STATE: defines if all or only NEW traffic is sent to moblock
  * blockcontrol and blocklists.list:
    - special keywords for special cases:
       notimestamp (blocklists on servers which don´t support timestamping)
       locallist (local blocklists)
  * blocklists.list:
    - changed list sources from .zip to .gz
    - added IANA lists
  * init:
    - relaxed "Required-Start", added "Required-Stop"
    - new description
  * minor changes, improved output

peerguardian (cvs20060228-5-20060321 aka cougar)
  * Now you can choose in /etc/default/peerguardian:
    Which Ports to whitelist (since last version)
    Which IPs to whitelist
    Which lines with IP-Ranges to remove from the blocklist
    Which lines with IP-Ranges to add to the blocklist
  * Changed init: Runlevel 0 and 6: S35; Runlevel S: S42
  * Reduced the warnings in ./INSTALL

peerguardian (cvs20060228-5-20060319)
  * Now /etc/default/peerguardian is used to *choose* how and if iptables rules
    shall be installed
  * added lestlest's iptables-solution with multiple seperate chains for
    whitelisting ports and integrating peerguardnf in other firewalls. This is
    new default.
  * All blocklists are now handled like .7z and .gz (before they were deleted
    after merging the blocklist

peerguardian (cvs20060228-5-20060316)
  * Using only logging functions from /lib/lsb/init-functions (In Debian there
    are also some non-LSB functions in this file. I don't know if they don't
    exist in other distros.
  * During INSTALL remove conflicting files from lestlest's debian package.
    This means that after removing this script the Debian package will be
    broken. In this case you have to uninstall and install it again!

peerguardian (cvs20060228-5-20060312)
  * This script depends on the new peerguardnf CVS version from lestlest
    because it assumes that the iptables rules aren't inserted by the daemon and
    that the PID is /var/run/peerguardnf.pid
  * logrotation uses HUP
  * The script is now LSB-compatible (I hope so, it uses LSB functions for
    starting/stopping and some log-messages).
  * 'status' is now implemented
  * The blocklists are now downloaded to /var/spool/peerguardian
  * The configuration file for which lists to download is now
    /etc/peerguardian.blocklists

peerguardian (20060303)
  * Support for 7z packed blocklists
  * One second delay between starting the daemon and removing the old iptables rules
  * INSTALL (re-)starts PeerGuardian, UNINSTALL stops PeerGuardian
  * Some logfile improvements
